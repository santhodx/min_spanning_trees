# min_spanning_trees

This is a code for a maze generator application. The maze is created by first generating a grid graph, which is a graph in which all vertices lie on an n x n grid and 
each vertex is connected by an edge to the vertices next to it both horizontally and vertically. The edges of the grid graph are then weighted with numbers between 0 and 1 
uniformly at random. 

Running The Application
The application can be run from the command line using 'java MazeViewer'.
The ‘p’ key toggles the path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, while the space bar generates a new random maze.
