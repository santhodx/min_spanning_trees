# min_spanning_trees

This is a code for a maze generator application. The maze is created by first generating a grid graph, which is a graph in which all vertices lie on an n x n grid and 
each vertex is connected by an edge to the vertices next to it both horizontally and vertically. The edges of the grid graph are then weighted with numbers between 0 and 1 
uniformly at random.
